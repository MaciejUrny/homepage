# HOMEPAGE

Hello, my name is Maciej Urny on my first website made about me as part of the YouCode course. The main purpose of creating this website is to learn and improve programming skills. On the website, apart from the mention of me, there is a table with honey prices. Contact details in connection with the "GDPR" have been made up.
